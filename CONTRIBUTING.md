# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute. This document covers how changes land.
Development setup lives in [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md); rules for AI agents live in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

## Ground Rules

- Smallest coherent change that solves the requirement
- No unrelated cleanup mixed into feature changes
- No new dependencies without justification (see the guideline's dependency discipline)
- Matcher changes must keep the Rust and vim-regex paths identical (cross-validation must stay green)

## Reporting a Bug

Issue-first: open an issue with a reproduction before opening a PR.

- Search existing issues first
- Include a minimal reproduction: the buffer text, what you typed, what you
  expected, and whether the native binary was in play (`rust/target/release/flash-cjk-search`)

## Proposing a Feature

Discuss before implementing: open an issue and collect feedback before writing
code — especially for new language tables, key binding changes, or anything
touching the invariants in [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Branch from `main`
2. Implement; keep `mise run check` green (and `mise run test` for matcher/labeler changes)
3. Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (validated by Cocogitto)
4. Open a PR; CI must pass
5. Review, then merge (squash merge unless otherwise stated)

## Review Expectations

Reviewers check:

- Correctness of the requested behavior
- No accidental scope creep, files, or dependencies
- Compatibility with architecture invariants and ADRs
- No sensitive information

## Commit Conventions

Conventional Commits, enforced by Cocogitto locally and in CI:

```text
feat(ko): add compound final handling
fix(rust): convert relative match lines to absolute buffer lines
```

With squash merging, the PR title must follow the same convention (it becomes the commit message).

## AI-Assisted Pull Requests

AI-generated or AI-assisted PRs are welcome under the same standard.
The description must clearly include:

- **Purpose**: what the change is for
- **Impact**: what is affected
- **Context**: relevant background
- **Risks**: potential concerns
- **Testing**: validation performed and its results

The GitHub pull request template mirrors these five requirements.
